Tenki Stats – Internal Metrics Dashboard
This project is a high-performance internal dashboard built for Tenki Digital, designed to visualize real-time web traffic and digital campaign metrics. The application adheres strictly to the modern, dark-themed corporate branding established by the Tenki Digital website, utilizing the signature #ea1948 red for all primary UI accents and data visualization.

Project Goal
The objective was to engineer a functional, responsive tool for the internal team to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) efficiently.

Key Features
Dynamic Data Visualization: Implements Chart.js to render dynamic line and doughnut charts, visualizing performance trends and campaign source distribution.

Interactive Controls: Features interactive filters for date ranges and campaign types, allowing analysts to simulate data segmentation and update the dashboard in real-time.

Persistent User Settings: Utilizes LocalStorage to save the user's preferences, including the selected theme (Dark/Light mode) and the last-applied filters, ensuring a personalized experience on return visits.

Robust Layout: The entire interface is structured using modern CSS Grid Layout, ensuring a complex, responsive design that adapts seamlessly from multi-column desktop views to a single-column layout for mobile devices.
